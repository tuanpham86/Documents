Improvement approach:
The pace of development requires a new approach to ensuring quality in each build.

- Pending Item:
	- Domain knowledge awareness

	- Test case template*
		- Need new template
		- Need to be more universal?
		
	- Practical working habit
	
	- View points: Checks if it is appropriate and complete.

	- Duty scope:
		- Bug advocating
		- Bug investigating
			- Splitting backlog item to several cases?
		- Bug report
			- Contain stack traces or are easy to read
			- 
	- Bug fixing is faster when:
		- Involve less people
		- Higher priority of bug
		- Bug fixing coordination patterns (communication between devs)
	
	- QA = QualityAssistance.Task:
		Testing tool
		Automation frame
		Knowledge sharing system
		Defect analysis tool
	
	- To improve:
		Questioning the assumption
		Culture
		Skill
		Mindset
	
	Report (KPI): Development / QA
	• Velocity (per team member) – Agile Methodology (to be implemented when Spencer is on board)
	• Backlog (enhancements)
	• Backlog (defects) – customer vs QA (by release)
	• Overtime (hours greater than 40 per person per week)
	
	• Average Testing Efficiency: Bugs per man months of testing effort (Average) - should be less than 50
		- (Total bugs during testing / testing effort in man months)
	• Average Customer Defect Density: Bugs reported by client after delivery Vs total testing efforts in man months.
		- (Total bugs after delivery / testing effort in man months)
	• Functional Test Failures: Number of failed functional test cases / Total number of executed functional test cases (monthly)
	• Bugs with Severity (Level 1/2/3)
	
	- Regression:
		- MPV as a guide
		- Exploratory is needed
		- Time must be plenty
		- Automation to fill up
		
- Build a Framework
	- What is a framework
	- What can this framework do?
	
	Points
		- Visibility
			• Readability
			• Typo mistake
			• Overlap, spill out
			• 
		- Functionality
			• Work as requirement?
			
		- Operational View restrict
			• Match with other sample?

			
		New setting?
			> Operational View restrict?

		New action?
			> User profile
			
		Estimation?
			- Scope of changes
			- # of entities
			- # of requirement
			- Familiarity
			
Automation (reply mail):
		
		Automation is lagging behind comparing to the progress of development team. 
		
		This is due to the fact that we have to wait for the code and the UI become stable before start developing UI automation script.
		Also, the current End to End solution goes through the application's bare-bones, navigate but doesn't provide all of the functionality yet.
		
		With that in mind the following are in scope of changes for Automation:
		- Add more scenarios to the backlog for Automation team, while the manual test script is being generated
		- Keep providing missing functionality, those scenarios with higher priority will be taken out first
		
		That will take awhile before we see any breakthrough or improvement on the overall quality but I believe we can achieve a better coverage of all missing functionality.
		
	To do:
		- Tracking & Report template
		- KPI:
			- Result: Useful vs Irrelevant
			- Coverage: Automation Test Case vs Manual Test Case

	1) The work that you are working (clear and logical structure)
		- Testing
			- Mainpac EAM
		- Consulting
			- EAM domain business
		- Communicating
			- Several common mistakes
	2) Try to make it short so that you can present in 10'
