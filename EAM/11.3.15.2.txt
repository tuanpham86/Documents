	Convert Requisition Line to Order:
		You can convert a single requisition line or batch convert multiple requisition lines.
		A requisition line can be added to:
			- An existing purchase order. This is the preferred order.
			- A new purchase order.

		If a requisition line is not added to the preferred order, Mainpac adds a new purchase order.

		Each time you batch convert multiple requisition lines, Mainpac groups the requisition lines onto new purchase orders. Requisition lines are grouped onto to the same purchase order if they have:
			- the same supplier; and
			- the same delivery warehouse; and
			- the same currency.
			- If you have configured Mainpac to Restrict Requisition Variance, the requisition line may revert to an "Approval PEing" when you attempt to convert it.

		- Execute test:
			- Source Warehouse on Requisition Line ~ Destination Warehouse??
			- When changing Requisition Line type: without reselecting the Priority the Preferred Order value is not refreshed. TBI.
			- Preferred Order does not work properly if Supplier is populated as a result of selecting Part. TBI.
			- Currency on Requisition Line? When is it disabled? TBI.
		
		- Investigate Preferred Order:
			- Added by MPV-2555
			- Revision on MPV-2810: improvements around clearing the preferred order, when it is no longer appropriate
			- Enhanced by MPV-4926: allow selecting Released Order (no big change to original logic)
			- Related:
				- http://jira.mainpac.com.au:8080/browse/MPV-5498 ( 11.3.12.13 )
				- http://jira.mainpac.com.au:8080/browse/MPV-5532 ( 11.3.12.13 )
			- Checking to see if the Preferred Order lookup check for Currency, Priority...
				
		- Reopening at SVN#12354: 
			- Clearing currency does not clear the Preferred Order
			- Out of Supplier, Currency, Delivery Priority, Destination Warehouse and Buyer Group there are only Supplier, Currency and Delivery Priority have real impact to Preferred Order when working with Requisition Line
			- Clearing or changing source warehouse does not clear the Preferred Order field
	
	Issue:
		- Defect: show Duplicate Operational Asset message...twice! TBI.
		- Destination Warehouse on Requisition Line is set to Requisition.WarehouseID (MPV-5649)
			- This could cause problem
