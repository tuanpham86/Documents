		The supplier correctly defaults to the part's preferred supplier.
		Default values are correctly set (and disabled) for values retrieved from the SupplierItem record:
			Supplier Item Name
			Unit of Purchase
			Tax
			Currency
		Now change the supplier to another supplier (which has not been associated with the part at all, and so there is no supplierItem record)
		Expected result:
			1. The following fields are cleared and enabled
				Supplier Item Name
				Unit of Purchase
				Unit Price
			2. The 'Currency' field is enabled, and defaults to the supplier's currency.
			3. The Tax field is enabled, and defaults to the suppliers tax code.
